# Suppose that 18 obese subjects were randomized, 9 each, to a new diet pill and a placebo. 
# Subjects' body mass indices (BMIs) were measured at a baseline and again after having received the treatment or placebo for four weeks.
# The average difference from follow-up to the baseline (followup - baseline) was ???3 kg/m2 for the treated group and 1 kg/m2 for the placebo group. 
# The corresponding standard deviations of the differences was 1.5 kg/m2 for the treatment group and 1.8 kg/m2 for the placebo group. 
# Does the change in BMI over the two year period appear to differ between the treated and placebo groups? 
# Assuming normality of the underlying data and a common population variance, give a pvalue for a two sided t test.
